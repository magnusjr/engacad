          <h1>About Magnus Jieyong Ryan</h1>
          <p>Hello evryone! My name is Magnus Jieyong Ryan and I am a student studying Mechanical Engineering at Singapore Polytechnic(SP).<br />
          This webpage will be used to document the progress of various projects I will be doing as part of SP's Engineering Academy(EA).</p>
          <hr />
          <p>Now after the brief introduction to what this webpage is about, I will share a few things about me personally. I am a very sporty<br />
          person, dabbling in many different sports such as football, badminton, ultimate frisbee and kayaking. My personal favourite is football<br />
          and I try to play matches with my friends as much as possible. Recently, I have also become hooked playing chess, I really enjoy challenging<br />
          my mind to think of solutions to efficiently move my pieces to checkmate someone and also leearn from other players of their thinking process.<br />
          I am also trying to pick up some musical instruments like Guitar and Ukulele but so far I only know some basic chords, tunes and strumming patterns.<br />
          </p>

          <p>The reason I joined the digfab program is to learn how to use 3D printers, laser cutters and other useful modern technologies to create <br />
          objects and parts. Using software like Fusion360 allows me to create any part I can think of with great detail and I love to use my creativity<br />
           to find the best possible way to create the required parts. It also lets me make new friends with the same keen intrest to learn about digital<br />
          fabrication and lets us work on projects <br />
          together.</p>
